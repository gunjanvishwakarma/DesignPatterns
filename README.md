# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns implemented in various programming languages.

## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows you to produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern that enables objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Bridge

Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that facilitates the construction of complex objects step by step. The pattern enables the creation of different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Chain Of Responsibility

Chain Of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Command

Command is a behavioral design pattern that transforms a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation enables passing requests as method arguments, delaying or queuing request execution, and supporting undoable operations.

## Composite

Composite is a structural design pattern that enables the composition of objects into tree structures and facilitates working with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Decorator

Decorator is a structural design pattern that permits attaching new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects containing the behaviors.

## Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that offers a simplified interface to a library, framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects to be created.

## Flyweight

Flyweight is a structural design pattern that supports handling vast quantities of objects by minimizing memory consumption.

## Iterator

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that enables traversing elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (e.g., list, stack, tree).

## Memento

Memento is a behavioral design pattern that allows saving and restoring the previous state of an object without revealing its implementation details.

## Observer

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events happening to the observed object.

## Prototype/Clone

Prototype/Clone is a creational design pattern that facilitates copying existing objects without introducing dependencies on their classes.

## Proxy

Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. It controls access to the original object, enabling actions before or after the request reaches the original object.

## Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to that instance.

## State

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to modify its behavior when its internal state changes, effectively appearing as if the object changed its class.

## Strategy

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, places each algorithm in a separate class, and makes their objects interchangeable. The pattern involves a context class that delegates work to a linked strategy object.

## Template Method

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines an algorithm's skeleton in a superclass and lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without altering its structure.

## Visitor

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that separates algorithms from the objects they operate on. The pattern involves placing new behavior in a separate visitor class, rather than integrating it into existing classes.
